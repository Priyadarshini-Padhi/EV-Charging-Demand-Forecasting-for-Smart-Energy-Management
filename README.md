# EV Charging Demand Forecasting for Smart Energy Management

Forecasting electric vehicle (EV) charging demand is essential for efficient energy distribution, grid load management, and smart infrastructure planning as EV adoption increases worldwide. This project uses machine learning to predict EV charging demand patterns and generate actionable insights for utilities, planners, and data practitioners.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains models, data, and analysis scripts for forecasting EV charging demand using historical charging patterns along with external features such as weather, time of day, and pricing. The goal is to support optimized energy distribution and reduce grid stress through accurate prediction and visualization.

## 📌 Key Features

- 📊 **Demand Prediction:** Machine learning models predict peak EV charging demand with over **85% accuracy**.
- 📈 **Actionable Insights:** Outputs include recommendations for dynamic pricing and charging infrastructure planning to reduce grid strain.
- 📉 **Performance Metrics:** Model evaluation metrics are provided for comparison and improvement.
- 📊 **Data Visualization:** Interactive dashboards and visual outputs support communication with stakeholders.
- 💡 **Business Value:** Forecast-informed decisions can improve station utilization and reduce operational inefficiencies.
